            <h2>Why The Gambia?</h2>
            <h3>Gambia, the smiling coast of Africa</h3>
            <p>
              Gambian history can be traced back centuries. The first Europeans
              to arrive on Kombo-St. Mary Island, today know as Banjul, were the
              Portuguese explorers in 1456. It was the stunning location of the
              country on the West Coast that attracted these European explorers
              in their quest to make it a base. The Gambia is the smallest
              country on mainland Africa, surrounded on all the three sides by
              Senegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a country, Gambia is known for its friendliness and warm
              hospitality together with a captivating people living with the
              peace, security and relative political stability which has been
              the case since independence in 1965. This, indeed, is the major
              reason the country is known as the smiling coast of Africa.
